# Dementia-Prediction
An ML based automatic Dementia Prediction Method
The alarmingly increasing rate of Dementia across the world without a proper di-agnostic procedure has made early diagnosis of Dementia a major health concern. Dementia is a common term used to describe symptoms that affect communication skills, memory, and performance in daily activities. 10-15% of the population over the age of 65 years and 50% of the population over the age of 85 years have some degree of dementia [1]. Although the symptoms of Dementia and Alzheimer's disease may be similar, classifying them is important for treatment. Through this study, a model is matured which helps in the early diagnosis of Dementia using the various machine learning models. Various models used in this proposed art are Support Vector Machine classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor. These classifiers are used to predict Dementia and determine the best model. Further, an ensemble learning classifier i.e., stacking classifier is used as a strategic combination of all the above-mentioned classifiers to achieve the best outcome. When compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning models, the results showed a 20% improvement resulting in which we obtained the highest accuracy of 93.33%.
